We keep forgetting to buy the crayon box but i will get it today also we had 
to redownload arduino because it wasnt showing up anymore.
We have everything we need now. buy monday im sure we'll have everything
close to finished, because our project isn't a difficult one.
Throughout the week we should be figuring out what is wrong and right 
with our project and buy the end of that week i'm sure it'll be almost 
finished, I hope we end up making a lot of progress and have no set
backs
